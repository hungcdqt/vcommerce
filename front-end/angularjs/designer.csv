16,Nettie Kent,"Raised by a painter and a librarian, Kent’s bohemian upbringing nurtured her creative spirit and abilities - she could hold a paint brush before she could talk. After studying mural painting in Mexico and fresco painting in Italy, Nettie made the move to New York City to pursue her love of art.

Kent’s organic forms, unique designs and her ethical approach to jewelry making emphasizes sustainable design and sourcing recycled materials.

While studying in Ghana, Meghan saw how she could bridge cultures and fuse worlds with a fashion product as that physical manifestation. In the coined ”urban indigenous” aesthetic, AFIA fuses the vibrant, traditional textiles of West Africa with American trends. The collections are made with cotton-wax printed in Ghana with a very short lifespan in the marketplace, resulting in forever limited-edition pieces of unique fabric. The colors, patterns, and motifs used in West African textiles are a visual representation of history, proverbs, moral values, and social codes.

24,Westward Leaning,"<p>Westward Leaning makes sunglasses that celebrate human achievement by incorporating unique materials specific to that moment, place and time. Their mission is to inspire and celebrate human achievement with products that are beautiful, meaningful and authentic. Westward Leaning donates $10 from every sale to fund education programs related to the specific achievements their sunglasses celebrate (all their sunglasses are dedicated to a particular social cause).</p>
<p>Without compromising on design or quality, Westward Leaning draws connections to social issues that are subtle and genuine -- they want to make customers feel good by offering the opportunity to express not only their personal style, but their passion for the world around them.</p>","The perfect sunglasses, on a social mission. ",False,"You have to be doing something right to get dozens of celebrities  from Ricky Martin to Emily Blunt to rock your shades. That's a pretty wide spectrum! Since launching in February of 2011 Westward Leanings have taken off and earned a popular following among fashion forward and socially conscious celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Natalie Portman, and Jessica Alba and many many more.  

So why are Westward Leanings so popular? For the founders of Westward Leaning that message is one of celebrating the triumphs of humanity. Each pair of sunglasses tells a distinct story, promotes a meaningful cause and conveys a message of hope. Westward Leanings are a true American throwback and serve as a reminder of the people and the ideals that made this country great. ""We want to make our customers feel good by offering them the opportunity to express not only their personal style, but their passion for the world around them"" says founder and creative director Robert Denning.

Westward Leanings were born out of a desire to integrate sustainability and elements of our society into fashion in a way that was genuine and real. As Denning jokes ""There aren't many fashions that allow you to incorporate different materials and elements of sustainability. You can't stick concrete on a blouse but you can inlay it on a pair of Westward Leanings.

25,Indigo Handloom,"<p>After years as a freelance journalist, founder Smita Paul decided to pursue her interest in handloom full time, creating Indigo Handloom in 2003. Smita formed Indigo Handloom not just to celebrate the beautiful fabrics produced by centuries-old weaving practices, but also the weavers themselves, most of whom struggle to support themselves and their families with a living wage.</p>
<p>Despite a surging Indian economy, weavers, farmers, and other members of the rural poor are faced with worsening economic conditions; indeed, since 2006, government sponsored subsidies for handloom associations (many of which supplied raw materials, micro-loans, and marketing and design assistance) have virtually disappeared, leaving many artisans without the guidance and financial support they need to pass on their talents to the next generation.</p>
<p>Indigo Handloom's feel-good-fabrics are all handmade by weavers, practicing their traditional craft in villages across South Asia. They select their weavers carefully to ensure that everything they sell is imbued with integrity and artistry. Through their work, they help sustain their weaver's environment and family-oriented way of life.</p>",Handmade Scarves that Celebrate the Ancient Craft of Handloom,False,,,http://indigohandloom.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

41,UNA Fashion,"<p>What started as a lifelong entrepreneurial dream for UNA Fashion founder Megan Doepker evolved into the philosophy that good business can make our world a better place. The mission narrowed and focused on seeing the economic disparity diminish between her home country, Canada, and the exotic places she so eagerly explored. Megan wanted to contribute a sustainable solution of alleviating the poverty that inflicts over half our global population who live on less than $2 a day. UNA Fashion took shape as the platform to achieve this mission of social justice while minimizing our impact on the environment; justice for our global society.</p>  

<p>During 5 months in India Megan sought out eco-friendly materials, artisans and organization that align with the values of her mission and represent what it means to ""fashion the change"". The mission was to create a sustainable fashion label where a purchase has a direct and positive impact on both people and the planet. A label that follows the principles of the slow fashion movement; to choose well and make it last. As a result, UNA Fashion collections are designed to be durable, timeless and functional.</p> 

<p>UNA Fashion is the result of a traveller, dreamer and idealist, and a journey that has only just begun.</p>","Freedom from the Sex Trade: Buy a Bag, Save a Life",False,,,http://www.unafashion.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

48,NearFar,"<p>Laid back elegance, whimsical west African prints and a voluminous silhouette are the order of the day for ethical fashion brand NearFar’s latest collection for spring /summer 2013, entitled the Bureh Collection.</p>
<p>Designer Stephanie Hogg has explored softer cuts and fluid proportions for the new collection with a focus on relaxed summer pieces in vibrant colours and prints which provide a hit of the exotic. Billowing maxi dresses, cocoon shapes and drop wasted shifts are teamed with contrasting structured jackets. The ever versatile and popular pencil skirt is given a refreshing summer update through a reincarnation in striking geometric prints nod to the swinging sixties while NearFar’s signature beach dresses, bags and clutches are all available in bold new prints.</p>
<p>Taking its inspiration from the colours of Sierra Leone’s capital Freetown, the collection is an ode to the determination, passion and sincerity of the Sierra Leonean people who have seen a significant year for their nation with a peaceful landmark 3rd presidential election since the end of the horrific civil war which ravaged this beautiful country.</p>
<p>The Bureh Collection was shot in the surroundings of an abandoned hotel in central Freetown to create a tangible juxtaposition between the stark, cool lines of the building and
the energetic, vivid colours and flowing shapes of the collection.</p>
<p>Sustainable development is at the heart of the NearFar ethos and the new Collection is launched as the brand has announced a new tuition programme in reading and writing for the young tailors they employ, most of whom missed out entirely on education during the civil war.

64,Indigenous,"<p>Knitting in many cultures is a time-honored tradition that has significant cultural meaning and purpose but sometimes does not yield the financial rewards that it should. Indigenous is proud to be part of the partnership which continues to elevate knitting and hand looming artisan cooperatives in some of the poorest regions of South America. Indigenous allocates more of their production cost to the artisan than typical conventional textile companies. This means the artisan makes a fair, living wage well above what they might earn working independently. In addition, they partner directly with non-governmental organizations and others that provide training, educational materials, and equipment that otherwise could not be afforded. Many partner organizations also offer no interest assistance loans in these communities. Indigenous places great value on their partnerships with artisans and the traditional knitting skills of their community. There are now over 300 artisan groups as part of their highly skilled production network.</p>

<p>The development of Indigenous's clothing starts from the ground up—literally. From the very beginning, Indigenous has been an all natural fiber company utilizing marino wool, alpaca, silk, organic cotton and other fibers created by nature. Their organic cotton is certified by Skal. Conventional cotton is one of the most pesticide-dependent crops, making the growing and harvesting of this fiber harmful to the water table and local communities. Their wool and alpaca fibers are also raised in a natural manner.</p>

<p>In many cases, Indigenous utilizes the natural colors of organic cotton and fleece, eliminating the need for dyes to achieve complex color schemes within our fashion collections. Indigenous also develops low impact dyes which contain no heavy metals and are Azo - dioxazine compound free.</p>

<p>Expect only the highest quality and fashion detail from Indigenous. You shouldn't ever have to sacrifice fashion and style to be a good global citizen. Indigenous's commitment to fair trade practices, knitting traditions and procurement of the finest natural fibers is unprecedented. Those who wear an Indigenous garment feel the special care taken to create each piece. By bringing together fashion and style with artisan handmade quality, Indigenous ensures you receive a combination unique in clothing.</p>","Premium quality fair trade, organic clothing for women",False,,,http://www.indigenous.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

67,Feral Childe,"<p>Feral Childe is an innovative womenswear line by bi‐coastal design duo Moriah Carlson (Brooklyn, NY) and Alice Wu (Oakland, CA). The label began as a series of art projects and has since evolved into a brand garnering critical praise and commercial success. Each season, Feral Childe's collaborative drawings form the basis of the collection's textile prints, wry construction details, and absurdist accessories. Feral Childe combines thoughtful choice of materials and attention to quality construction to make smart, wearable silhouettes for forward-thinking women.</p> 

<p>Studios are in both Brooklyn (Sunset Park) and Oakland (Temescal), while all Feral Childe is proudly manufactured in New York City's Garment Center.</p>

<p>Feral Childe's playful silhouettes and curiously elegant tailoring quickly gained a devoted following, at home and abroad, among young and old, traditionalists and renegades. Each piece in the collection has been designed with sustainability in mind, from the choice of fabric, printing and dyeing treatments, to details such as buttons and trim. All of their styles fulfill at least two or more of these standards:

<ul>
<li>use of natural and sustainable fibers, whether chemical-free (such as organically grown cotton or hemp, which requires no pesticides), closed-process (Tencel instead of rayon), upcycled (recycled hemp fibers, batting made from recycled PET soda bottles), or surplus (mill-end designer wool coating, overstock nylon mesh)</li>
<li>manufacturing locally in New York City. Our clothes are sewn in a sunfilled factory in NYC's Garment Center. The factory is owned by a husband and wife team who oversee healthy working conditions and fair wages for their employees.</li>
<li>conscientious application of printing and dyeing (less water-intensive digital printing for the silks; water-based silk screening; low impact dyes; use of domestic printers (Los Angeles, San Francisco) and dyehouses in Marin County and in Brooklyn)</li>
<li>responsible disposal of production waste: remnants are sent to a textile recycling facility, donated to crafters and schools, or recycled into accessories and trim for future collections</li>
<li>use of vintage deadstock buttons or those made from natural materials such as shell or tagua nut
produced to order based on our wholesale orders, to avoid overstock and excess inventory; this way, you are also guaranteed that each Feral Childe piece is part of a limited run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feral Childe is committed to ethical business practices, providing transparency about sourcing and manufacturing techniques upon request to customers. They carefully distribute only to retailers we feel share their values. They limit their use of polybags and plastic hangers, reusing these for future production cycles, and ship with recycled materials whenever possible.</p>","Smart, wearable clothing for forward-thinking women ",False,,,http://www.feralchilde.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

71,Pima Doll,"<p>Pima Doll, as the name suggests, is a pima cotton collection. It is designed in New York and manufactured in Peru, from the world's best pima cotton. Pima Doll puts a fun twist on the cotton basic, treating the fabric in innovative ways. The fabric is perforated, cut, distressed and knit back together again. Careful not to waste the precious pima, the leftover cuttings of the tee's are upcycled into beautiful, one of a kind hand knits. The result is an exciting pima cotton collection of tops, leggings, dresses and unique hand knit pieces.</p>

<p>Pima Doll uses Peruvian pima cotton exclusively, known as one of the finest cotton's in the world. Our cotton is grown along the lush Peruvian coast lines. The combination of Peru's coastal climate, the type of seed and soil, all contribute to the ideal growing conditions. Pima is an extra long staple cotton, the long fibers being highly resistant. For these reasons our cotton apparel does not pill. Pima is incredibly durable and known to last 50% longer than ordinary cotton. We use 100% pure pima cotton, no synthetic blending. Furthermore our cotton is grown without chemicals and is hand harvested, therefore having no adverse environmental impact. Our collection is natural and hypo-allergenic. We suggest machine or hand washing and we do not recommend dry cleaning, which can be toxic.</p>","Style, Attitude, Sustainability",False,,,http://pimadoll.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

73,Knotty Gal,"<p>As the brainchild of NY-based mother-daughter duo Nur-E Gulshan Rahman and Nur-E Farhana Rahman, Knotty Gal is the producer of one-of-a-kind knotted, handmade accessories for a cause!</p>

<p>Knotty Gal’s first collection, recently launched on May 30th, is designed by the pair and hand-crafted by Nur-E Gulshan Rahman, who incorporates intricate knots into bold, colorful, and one-of-a-kind statement pieces. Each of Knotty Gal’s necklaces, bracelets, and earrings is made from a combination of carefully selected cords and metals to produce a modern take on classic knots.</p> 

<p>Delightfully “knotty” by nature, the line is equally as “nice” in purpose. Knotty Gal is the result of the founders’ desire to raise funds for the Bhandari Girls’ School in Bogra, Bangladesh. Founded in 1962 by Nur-E Farhana’s great-grandfather, the institution was the first all-girls school in the region. Today, the student body has swelled to over 1,000 girls, approximately 90% of whom come from extreme poverty.</p>

<p>After visiting the school in 2011 and seeing the overcrowded classrooms, lack of educational materials, and overall lack of resources, Nur-E Farhana knew something had to be done. She and her mother decided to combine their creative passions with their desire to help and create an accessories line that would resonate with knotty gals everywhere.

74,Dirty Librarian Chains,"<p>What makes Dirty Librarian Chains stand out is that designer Susan Domelsmith knows avant-garde fashion can be sustainable. Her collection is founded on a zero waste design model and ensures the production of every piece utilizes USA made materials dating from the 1960’s to the 1980’s.  Referencing the surroundings of her NYC home base, Domelsmith incorporates bold retro-futuristic structures into her jewelry designs.

<p>Her collection has been seen many times on the runway during New York Fashion Week as well as featured in countless publications including British Vogue, Elle, NY Magazine, Huffington Post, WWD, and Teen Vogue.

She fosters creativity in other aspiring designers through teaching apprenticeships as well as offering workshops where her students learn the basics of jewelry making and create new pieces from their own meaningful treasures and heirlooms.

76,Neuaura,"<p>Founded in 2007, Neuaura is an an eco-conscious, animal free footwear company that provides an assortment of footwear ranging from summer sandals to faux fur lined winter boots.  They do their best to ensure the manufacturing process and materials leave minimal impact on our planet.</p> 

<p>A portion of Neuaura's manufacturing is done in a factory located in Southern Brazil. This factory is part of a union that decided to take the responsibility of solid waste of the entire production process seriously and make it less harmful to the environment. In 1996, the project ""Amanha Mais Feliz"" (A Happier Tomorrow), led by the Union of the Footwear and Footwear Components Companies, was born.</p>

<p>For the past 10 years, the project has expanded tremendously. Now the union has a techno-environmental complex that includes Screening of Industrial Waste Plant, Convention Center, Environmental Studies Center and Administrative Headquarters. The investment for the construction of this facility was $1.27 million.</p>

<p>In this initiative, the proper separation of waste at the factory level ensures that everything that can be reused is recycled and goes back to the industrial process. Each factory that is part of the union, and has implemented the recycling practice in their facility, stamps a green seal on all the boxes which certifies this practice on their products. The seal is printed on all Neuaura shoeboxes so consumers can identify that the shoes were manufactured in a green facility.</p>

<p>The entire process starts with the segregation and collection of waste generated in the factories, which is transported to the Screening Plant, where it is reviewed, weighed, recorded and pressed. After this process, the waste is sent to its intended destination: recycling companies.</p>

<p>Of the 250 tons per month of waste, an average of 68% is reused. The remaining waste is taken to the Hazardous Industrial Waste Landfill. This site was built within strict technical and security standards. The un-recyclable materials (mostly chrome dyed leather) are stored here until they find new technology to recycle and reuse this material.</p>

<p>Neuaura's factory is powered by hydroelectricity which uses renewable resources. (Hydroelectric power produces no direct waste and has significantly lower output level of carbon dioxide.) The factory also advocates recycling and protection and preservation of endangered animals to their surrounding communities. They sponsor a habitat for endangered animals native to their area that serves as an educational tool and provides an overall awareness to the community.</p>",Vegan shoes and sandals for the eco-conscious woman,False,,modacore/designers/images/DesignerGate-neuaura.jpg,http://www.neuaurashoes.com/,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

85,Beija-Flor Jeans,"<p>Beija-Flor is dedicated to using only the highest quality denim and finishing, and supports eco-friendly and fair-labor production. Beija-Flor’s high performance denim, certified grading system, and engineered fit, has led the mother-daughter design team to the creation of the perfect fitting jean. The brand gains inspiration from the elegant designs of Brazilian fashion, while adapting to the needs and tastes of the American woman.</p>

<p>Beija-Flor’s dedication to social and environmental responsibility is a major difference between their jeans and many imported jeans. All of their facility partners are also dedicated to high standards of social responsibility; they don't just pay wages, but they distribute food, offer medical care, and sometimes transportation - definitely not your typical textile facility.</p>

<p>Brazil has some of the strongest labor laws in the world, including a law that gives all salaried employees an extra month’s pay at the end of the year. Brazilian law permits a 44-hour work week, nothing longer.</p>

<p>The Beija-Flor production facility that makes their jeans, and the larger company that make their denim, are both ISO certified for their dedication to environmental responsibility and standards. Both their denim manufacturer and their cut and sew facility have their own waste water treatment facilities on site. They actually use cashew nut shells to produce some of the steam needed for production! And they offer employee incentives for coming up with new ways to be eco-friendly. The denim itself is actually recycled - the process, yarn, and fabric remnants are reused to produce new denim.</p>",The world's best jeans according to Oprah Magazine,False,,,http://www.ilovethesejeans.com/pages/our-promise,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

86,Natalie Frigo,"<p>Natalie Frigo's passion is creating unique, handcrafted jewelry that treasures the extraordinary beauty in every client. Sculpting all of the designs by hand in her lower Manhattan studio, Natalie personally attends to each detail using the ancient practices of metalsmithing and 'cire perdue' (also known as lost-wax casting). The organic forms are then cast and finished in New York City, marrying recycled metals with personally selected, ethically sourced gemstones.</p>

<p>Natalie's inspiration ranges from early metallurgy and textile design to recent architectural developments, culminating in a collection that is contemporary, but by referencing venerable artifacts, also feels timeless.</p>

<p>Conflict-free stones ensure that no person was forced to mine a stone in unsafe or illegal working conditions. All of Natalie Frigo's diamonds, for example, are individually tracked through their full chain of custody to ensure that ethical practices are used in mining, cutting and polishing. Ethically sourced goes beyond conflict-free - these gemstones are delivered from mines that provide a living wage, ensure safe working conditions and protect the environment by limiting dangerous chemicals and developing plans for restoring the land after mining is complete.</p>

<p>Recycled and reclaimed metals eliminate a tremendous amount of new pollution and contaminated water. An average, newly mined 18-karat gold ring (weighing less than an ounce) creates twenty tons (!) of waste, whereas a recycled ring creates almost none. Since recycled metal is as beautiful and timeless as newly mined and indistinguishable in its use as a raw material, the choice is a simple one.</p>

<p>Timeless jewelry like Natalie's helps reduce waste by giving you pieces that will last generations. Buy a few great pieces of jewelry that you will love for a lifetime instead of acquiring a drawer full of things you rarely wear and then forget about after a season.</p>",Jewelry that treasures the extraordinary beauty in every client,False,,,http://bynataliefrigo.com/pages/about,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

92,Palma Collection,"<p>The inspiration for Palma came from the desire to make a positive change in society. Palma Collection believe that they are making a difference and will continue working their best to share with you an exotic, exciting, and original jewelry inspired by nature’s beauty.</p>
<p>Palma Collection artisans carefully and masterfully handcraft each individual piece of jewelry into stunning, colorful, and stylish designs that are dazzling the fashion industry. Each unique piece is made from a rare palm tree nut found only along South America’s coastline. Each item is individually crafted to perfection, no two pieces are identical.</p>
<p>The material used in their jewelry comes from the nut of a rare palm tree that grows only along the South American coast. The nut is harvested seasonally, only after it falls off the palm tree. Furthermore, it’s non-toxic.</p>
<p>Palma Collection also donates 5% of their gross sales to causes that support preserving Earth’s resources and fighting cancer.</p>
<p>Palma Collection products are classified as vegetable ivory. More specifically it comes from the “Phytelephas Macrocarpa” palm tree, which only grows in the tropical rain forests of the South American Pacific coasts. These palms are short in size and grow in the humid forest, under the canopy. When the flowers of the male palm open, they drop a sweet perfume, which fills all around. Before becoming ripe, the fruit of the female palm has a sweet milk that the locals like to drink. Its fruit looks like a bunch of pineapples inside of which you find the nuts. When they ripen, the fruit drops to the ground, and the nuts can be collected for processing. Afterwards, they must be left to dry for 2 months, and they become extremely hard.</p>
<p>Their size is usually equal to a chicken egg. From each bunch you can extract up to 40 nuts. The palm begins to fruit at 10 years of age, and produces around 15 to 20 kilos of nuts per year. They have an outer hard shell that can be separated after a few weeks. Then there is the nut with a dark skin, which protects the ivory.</p>
<p>The nut is non-toxic as are the dyes used; neither have any smell. Its cellular structure is similar to animal ivory, but it’s a little smoother, harder, and more manageable. It looks just like animal ivory in its texture, and cream color, but does have a hole inside; the nut has a hollow in the middle with a small canal running to its base, but this can be avoided when carving.</p>
<p>Once the nuts reach the artisan crafter they are polished until they get that clean and shiny look. Then the nuts are cut with extreme care in order to give them different forms, and they are French-dyed into various vivid colors. Finally, precise holes are made into the pieces to create the necklace designs with the use of premium leather straps. In the case of the earrings, silver sterling is used for the hooks. The uniqueness of the material is also reflected in its exotic colors and creative designs, and also in the fact that each piece of the necklace or earring is one of a kind.</p>",Handcrafted and unique eco-friendly jewelry,False,,,http://store.palmacollection.com/pages/about-us,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

93,People Tree,"<p>For every beautiful garment People Tree makes, there's an equally beautiful change happening somewhere in the world. When you wear People Tree, you look good and feel good knowing your unique garment was made with respect for people and the planet.</p>
<p>People Tree is recognized by customers and the fashion industry as a pioneer in Fair Trade and environmentally sustainable fashion. For over twenty years, People Tree has partnered with Fair Trade artisans and farmers in the developing world to produce a collection of ethical and eco fashion. Fair Trade is about creating a new way of doing business, creating access to markets and opportunities for people who live in the developing world.</p>
<p>When you shop with People Tree, you can trust that your goods were made ethically and sustainably. People Tree is a different kind of fashion business. They give customers an alternative to fast fashion. The fast fashion industry is fueled by insatiable demand for cheap clothing and accessories. Fast fashion has a devastating impact, from sweatshops and child labour to pollution and global warming. Slow Fashion means standing up against exploitation, family separation, slum cities and pollution – all the things that make fast fashion so successful.</p>
<p>People Tree make beautiful garments that are a living blueprint for their values: people and the planet are central to everything they do. Their garments are hand crafted in organic cotton and sustainable materials, using traditional skills that support rural communities.</p>
<p>In the past, ethical, Fair Trade, organic, sustainable were not words people think of as fashionable. People Tree has transformed ethical fashion into something that is desirable and glamorous. They design and produce high quality, fashionable products for women and men. They also collaborate with leading designers to produce unique collections.</p>
<p>People Tree provide you with exclusive fashion while at the same time they improve the lives and environment of the artisans and farmers in developing countries. While many fashion brands talk about corporate social responsibility or ethical fashion, they go further. They follow the principles of Fair Trade in every aspect of their business. All of their products are made by artisans and producers who work to Fair Trade standards. In 2012 and 2013, People Tree has been a pilot case for certification for Fair Trade Manufacture under the World Fair Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>People Tree developed the first integrated supply chain for organic cotton from farm to final product and were the first organization anywhere to achieve GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certification on a supply chain entirely in the developing world.</p>
<p>They also work hard to ensure that they pioneer sustainable methods of production to minimise environmental impact. Not only is most of their cotton certified organic and Fairtrade, all their clothes are dyed using safe and natural dyes. People Tree source as many products as they can locally, choosing natural and recycled products over toxic, synthetic and non-biodegradable materials.</p>","Trust, transparency, fair trade fashion",False,,,http://www.peopletree.co.uk/about-us/mission,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

95,Sword & Plough,"<p>Sword & Plough has been in the making since its founders, Emily and Betsy Nunez, were born at West Point into a military family. Growing up watching their dad lead early morning battalion runs, sharing Thanksgiving dinners with hundreds of soldiers at mess halls, and watching their uncle, a Marine NASA Astronaut pilot, launch his space shuttle, are just a few of the experiences that inspired Emily to serve as an officer in the U.S. Army and start Sword & Plough with Betsy.</p>

<p>As one of only three Army ROTC cadets studying in the bucolic setting of Middlebury College and commuting to the University of Vermont for training, Emily sometimes found it difficult to relate her military commitment to her fellow classmates; many of whom had never met someone that served in the military. The Nunez sisters wanted to create something that would emotionally and physically touch civilians in their everyday lives and remind them, in a beautiful way, of the challenges our country and servicemen face, and the power that every person has to help.</p>

<p>Most individuals use a bag of some form throughout their day. By recycling and repurposing military gear with a fashionable touch, and working with veterans, we create sturdy and sophisticated products, whose sale will empower veteran employment, reduce waste and strengthen civil-military understanding. In this way, our bags are rugged, refined and relevant.</p>

<p>Sword & Plough was founded in 2012. Returning to Middlebury after attending the U.S. Army Airborne School, Emily cultivated the initial idea for Sword & Plough through close work with Middlebury’s Center for Social Entrepreneurship. Since then, Sword & Plough has participated in the Dell Social Innovation Lab, won first place and the Audience Choice Award at the Harvard Pitch for Change Competition, and pitched on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the Kairos Global Summit.</p>","""Made in the USA by veterans with surplus military fabric.

96,Carolina K,"<p>Carolina K was created by Argentinian musician and fashion designer Carolina Kleinman. With a background in design, music, yoga, dance and photography, Carolina continuously allows these eclectic interests to resonate throughout her collections.</p>

<p>Inspired by world travels across Latin America, India and many other destinations, Carolina finds her most influential creativity from indigenous cultures, markets, people and history. Pairing vintage clothes with hand crafted knits or pleating reflects her versatility and unique approach to fashion. Known for bright colors and intricate detailing, Carolina K truly represents a combination of ancient cultures updated with sophisticated style.</p>

<p>Proudly working with underdeveloped communities in Latin America, Carolina stays true to her original mission of supporting factories and artisans who work within the guidelines of Fair Trade regulations. Carolina’s continuous work with the local people of such communities, allows her to translate an ancient culture into modern works of art.</p>

<p>Over the years, Carolina has worked closely with many communities in Latin America. During that time, Carolina K has developed unique relationships with these artisans, based on a long history of mutual respect and fair dealings. That's why they take our commitment to fair trade with the artisans with whom they work season after season. We are glad that the artisans who make our production work in satisfactory conditions and are treated with dignity and respect.</p>

<p>Carolina's commitment to the many artisans goes well beyond paying fair wages. They are also committed to supporting many local causes in Peru and Mexico. Carolina K helps support an orphanage in Peru and helps raise funds for them too.</p>
<p>Carolina K feels very fortunate to do business with the many talented artisans and communities they work with throughout Latin America, and are also very pleased by the improvements they have helped to create for them.

Because they believe that jewelry is so much more than just an accessory, they invest their energies into putting thoughtful and sustainable pieces into the world. </p>

<p>LAB by Laura Busony choose to work with metal because it is a lasting element that can be molded, melted, sawed, and hammered, but will never cease to exist. Each piece that LAB by Laura Busony creates is entirely carved by hand in Brooklyn, New York. The metal is subsequently poured by hand, finished by hand, and assembled by their team of artists in their cozy Greenpoint studio space. All of the additional items that they use for their production processes are sourced locally from their community of other small businesses. </p>

<p>As a company, LAB by Laura Busony believe deeply in their community and collaborating with those around them, so you’ll never catch them outsourcing work to catch a break or using unethical means of production to get ahead.

They exist for fellow artists, for those with their own sense of style, and for those who appreciate individuality and quality in every aspect of their lives.

Designers Rosario Frojan and Alfredo Olmedo are passionate about their product using only natural fibers such as wool, linen, and cotton. Their overcoats, jackets and sweatshirts are made of boiled wool, and undergo a special ageing process that gives them their D-Due signature look. Every garment is finished by hand and produced locally in their workshop or by local craftsman, and artists literally brush paint, spray paint and silkscreen on each individual piece. Truly unique, D-Due reflects the love of tailoring and nature.

One small problem, in 1994, Organic personal care was an unheard of concept, and the toxic dangers of conventional personal care were not very well understood.</p>
 
<p>Starting with Calendula infused, Baby Bottom Balm, she set out on the quest to create a clean safe product that would replace toxic body wash and lotion.

152,Odacite ,"<p>It all started in 2004 when founder and CEO Valérie Grandury was diagnosed with breast cancer. This event triggered a desire to completely reinvent her life, reconnect with nature and step into a beautiful and fascinating healing journey. In order to heal, Valérie felt the necessity to detoxify her environment. She adopted a raw food diet, quit her job in the film business to dedicate her time to learning and studying the healing power of plants and became a Health and Wellness Coach.</p>

<p>Valerie soon discovered that one of the most toxic elements in a women's daily lives are personal care products. She soon realized that the very expensive French brand she slathered on her face with confidence every day was a cocktail of dangerous chemicals, some of which were known carcinogens!</p>

<p>Much to her astonishment, when she turned to organic skin care, she discovered that the products did not bear a manufacturing date and she wondered how the ingredients could retain any active properties after so many years in a jar.</p>

<p>Emboldened by her new philosophy of not cutting corners when it came to health, Valérie decided to start making her own fresh skin care. The underlying motto she applied to food, “It all lies in the freshness of the raw ingredients,” would apply to her skin care. She sourced the freshest, purest organic ingredients from all over the world and formulated her own age-defying blends. The secret to her magical ointments, then and now, is to use freshly made skin care in a window of time during which each ingredient retains its full freshness and efficiency. And so, the Freshiency Date was born.</p>

<p>The crèmes made such a difference on her skin that she gave them as presents to her friends. It was an instant hit. Odacité was born to answer a growing demand for women who saw the difference that those blends made on their skin.</p>",Pure organic ingredients with age-defying blends,False,"Odacite Natural and Organic Skincare: Pure Beauty at it's Best 

It takes something exceptional to be featured so often in Vogue, Elle, Vanity Fair, W Magazine and countless other magazines. For Odacite Natural and Organic Skin Care, that special attribute is an unceasing commitment to the best and freshest raw organic ingredients in their skincare.

It all started in 2004 when founder and CEO Valérie Grandury was diagnosed with breast cancer. This event triggered a desire to completely reinvent her life, reconnect with nature and step into a beautiful and fascinating healing journey. Like so many that have been diagnosed with this horrible disease, Valérie decided to detox and better understand what she was eating and wearing on her face and body.

Emboldened by her new philosophy of not cutting corners when it came to health, Valérie decided to start making her own fresh skin care. The underlying motto she applied to food, “It all lies in the freshness of the raw ingredients,” would apply to her skin care.

157,Catrinka Project,"<p>Catrinka is an ethical fashion accessories label that invests in women and girls. Their first effort, the Catrinka Project, was inspired by Girl Rising, a documentary film about girls education, and features a bag made by women artisans in each of the ten countries featured in the film. A portion of the profits from these unique bags go to efforts to remove barriers between girls and education in the countries where the bags were made. Buy a Bag, Employ a Woman, Educate a Girl.</p>

<p>We are three friends in New York City, all with international roots and a passion for investing in women and girls around the world. Amisha is a designer and Sumana and Megan are avid collectors of beautiful things from around the world – things with a story and a soul. Megan, who has worked on four continents to leverage the power of the private sector to create social change, knows how to run things. Amisha, who founded the girls clothing line Ode Kids, knows how to make things. Sumana, who co-founded a charity for orphaned girls in India, knows how to invest in girls. They came together to form Catrinka in late 2012.</p>

<p>Their goal is to make products with a soul, and a story, and to provide our customers with a sense of intimacy between them and the women who made their bags, and the girls who benefit from their purchase. Fashion should make you feel fabulous! And knowing where our products come from, and where the proceeds go, makes us feel even more glamorous.</p>

<p>They named their label after Megan’s 5-year old daughter, Caterina (nicknamed “Catrinka”). They hope their cause and mission speak to anyone who knows a little girl, or a woman who wants to make her daughter’s dreams come true.</p>

159,Quazi Design,"<p>Quazi Design's journey began in 2009 when they became a formal business in order to create much needed employment in Swaziland. They began with the concept of a simple rolled paper bead earring displayed on a card and employing one artisan, Sibongile, who later became the production manager.</p>

<p>The business was co-founded by Doron, a designer from the UK and Flotsam, the local magazine distributors. Doron became the driving force behind the enterprise and since 2009 has lived and worked in Swaziland building a sustainable business model with a dynamic balance between economic and social goals, believing that design driven handcraft can be a powerful tool for empowerment and economic independence. The core of the business is pushing the boundaries of craft and sustainable design through innovative techniques and continuous product development. All products are handmade and utilise 100% waste magazines.</p>

<p>Quazi Design developed the original paper beads to create their own signature style. In 2011 they opened a retail shop in Swaziland at the Ngwenya Glass complex near the Oshoek border to South Africa.</p>

<p>They also became a member of SWIFT Swaziland fair trade network and worked closely with other local handcraft businesses in its strategic planning. In 2012 Quazi moved into a large workshop situated in Sidwashini, the industrial area of Mbabane. Tables are made from old doors, storage from recycled palettes, and shelves from magazines.</p>

<p>The new workshop gives them space for creativity and growth as they continue to build relationships with distributors across the globe including South Africa, Europe, USA and Australia. </p>

<p>Each collection is motivated by a new technique; like creating paper wood from waste magazines by bringing the paper back to its original form. In 2013 Quazi launched a 'One Of A Kind' collection of individual jewellery pieces, using waste magazine paper in a unique method and set up a small brass workshop working with recycled metals.<p>

<p>Their business model is built on sustainable design, a philosophy that combines the principles of social, economic and ecological sustainability. Quazi believes in treating people, planet and profit equally, building a business where ethical and social standards balance with cutting edge design.</p>

<p>For Quazi, the key to sustainability is good design that respects the environment and its producers. All products utilise 100% waste magazines sourced locally and each product is handmade at their workshop in Swaziland, Southern Africa. They reduce their environmental impact through recycling and use of eco-friendly materials and practices. Their workshop meets fair-labour standards, including fair wages, safe working conditions, job training, empowerment and transparency for staff. They are a member of the Fellowship 500 a platform for innovators in fashion and sustainability launched by the Ethical Fashion Forum.</p>",Transforming paper waste from magazines into original accessories,False,,modacore/designers/images/QuaziDesign.jpg.png,,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

162,Dikokore Designs,"<p>dikokore designs was founded with an artistic spirit and a social mission: to influence our views of Africa by exposing African crafts and creating quality, well-designed African-inspired products. With a purpose: women and education.</p>

<p><b>The beginning.</b></p>

<p>The collaboration of a fearless young couple and a community of beautiful people, dikokore designs began as a way to create a grass roots approach to positive change in one small village.</p> 

<p>Heather was a Peace Corps volunteer in northern Benin. After two years of working in education, gender development and environmental awareness, she walked away with a deeper sense of community and greater appreciation for the women who embraced her into their lives. She learned of the educational gap between boys and girls in many rural African villages and witnessed the gap widen as students progressed in school. In sub-saharan Africa for every ten boys there are just four girls enrolled in school.</p>

<p>During the same time, Juan wrote his Master’s thesis on Social Entrepreneurship and the impacts that private and social enterprises can have in developing communities. During his own visits to Benin, Juan became enthralled with the country and the greater continent of Africa and continuously thought of ways to provide social and sustainable tools to empower people.</p>

<p>Heather joined Juan in their move to Los Angeles in 2012. They developed a strong business model and founded dikokore designs as their humble effort to create high-quality products while working with some of the most vulnerable communities in the world.</p>

<p><b>Design with a Purpose.</b></p>

<p>Heather and Juan have a passion for good design, and they also have lots of choices of how we spend our dollar. Supporting fair trade and social businesses is one way of making their voices heard and shaping the world that they love and want to live in.</p>

<p>Through partnering with the Benin Education Fund, Heather and Juan have created a strong relationship that allows them to invest in the education of girls from Dikokore. They work directly with the women artisans cooperative to make their bracelets available to a wider community of consumers. Additionally, with every grass bracelet sold they are able to contribute towards grants and scholarships for girls in need.</p>

<p><b>The future of dikokore designs.</b></p>

This year, Heather and Juan are looking to spread the word about Dikokore bracelets. They are looking to travel to Benin and award their first scholarships to girls from Dikokore. With your support, they will expand their reach, add new lines and continue to support local communities. </p>

The Indosole set out on a mission. By stripping the outside lining from motorcycle tires and using the rubber to create the sole of the shoes, they discovered a way to create shoes with soul.

From there, the team used organic canvas to envelope the soles and voila, Indosoles were born.",modacore/designers/images/Indosole.jpg_2.png,,,"<p><b>FREE Shipping on orders over $100 to the USA and Canada!</b></p>

It was with this lifestyle in mind that she founded Loup Charmant, a collection of diaphanous, feminine pieces for everyday, all day wear. The brand name, meaning charming wolf, is a reference to Edwards’ own coming-of-age time living in France and evokes the sensuality and subtle flirtatiousness that is inherent to her brand. </p>
<p> Inspired by the fuss-free appeal of beach dressing, Edwards set out to offer that sensibility to women, year-round. The Loup Charmant story began in 2006 when Edwards discovered the heirloom quality fabric that allowed her to bring her vision to life.
